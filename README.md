***********Geolocation API***********
Very useful points: 
1. It is used to locate a user's position.
2. To get a user's position by using getCurrentPosition().
3. The getCurrentPosition() method uses properties to return latitude, longtitude and accuracy. 

Here are frequently used properties: 

1. coords.latitude
2. coords.longitude
3. coords.accuracy

Other methods: 

1. watchPosition() - It helps us to return current position and updated position of the current user.
2. clearWatch() - To stop watchPosition.

Happy coding.
